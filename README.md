This is the analysis of the transect data from panama 2014:

First important code is transect_analysis.py to make a dictionary out of a table, in which important metadata is stored and additionally .csv-files (output of thunderfish), which have different fish frequencies and amplitudes stored

Second important code is raster_plots.py to make rasterplots of the found frequencies of the first code.
